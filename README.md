# VirtualGameCoin
VGC Team WorkSpace
VGCTeam released the world's first Android mobile POW miner tool！

VirtualGameCoin was founded in 2020. Prior to the development of the VGC blockchain, we issued the VGC token on the TRON(trc20) network. Now, the VGC token(trc20) can be bridged to the VGC blockchain using the VGC blockchain bridge.

VirtualGameCoin BlockChain (VGC BlockChain) is the world’s first innovative blockchain network that supports using mobile phones as mining nodes. The barriers for miners to join are lower, and the process is more user-friendly. Anyone with an Android phone can join the VGC mainnet and become a mining node, contributing CPU power to assist the main nodes in processing transactions. The VGC mainnet employs a Proof-of-Work (POW) mechanism to reward mining nodes for their contributions.
